# Context-Aware Relative Object Queries to Unify Video Instance and Panoptic Segmentation (CVPR 2023):

We develop a simple approach for multiple video segmentation tasks, video instance segmentation, multi-object tracking and segmentation and video panoptic segmentation, using the propagation of context-aware relative object queries (CAROQ).
